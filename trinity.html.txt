<p>I chose Trinity University because I wanted to stay within San Antonio and close to my family, plus, its cheaper this way!</p>
<p>I hope to major in Poltical Science because its a major I know a can excel in, and when applying to places such as Vet School, they prefer you major in something your good at. Here are some links to important information about my chosen interest:
